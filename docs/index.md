## Welcome

I am a software engineer and U.S. Air Force Veteran who approaches development with a structured, disciplined, and systems-oriented mindset. I build full-stack applications and backend systems designed to solve real problems in practical and reliable ways. I value ownership, follow-through, and continuous learning, and I approach my work with integrity and persistence.

Whether working independently or within a team, I prioritize clear communication, organized execution, and steady improvement. I aim to be an engineer others can rely on, contributing meaningfully while maintaining accountability and long-term quality in every project I collaborate on.
