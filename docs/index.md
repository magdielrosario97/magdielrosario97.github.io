## Welcome

I am a software engineer and U.S. Air Force Veteran who approaches development with a structured, disciplined, and systems-oriented mindset. I build modular applications and backend systems designed to solve real problems in practical and reliable ways. I value ownership, follow-through, and continuous learning, and I approach my work with integrity and persistence.

Whether working independently or within a team, I prioritize clear communication, organized execution, and steady improvement. I aim to be an engineer others can rely on, contributing meaningfully while maintaining accountability and long-term quality in every project I collaborate on.

## Featured Project

### Vault 166

Vault 166 is a modular Python application built around a rule-driven game engine and persistent state management system. Originally created as a scripting project, it was redesigned into a structured, multi-module architecture emphasizing separation of concerns, scalable game logic, and database-backed persistence.

The project demonstrates applied software engineering principles through class-based architecture, graph-modeled navigation, rule-based state evaluation, and SQLite persistence using normalized relational modeling.
